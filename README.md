## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a High level, object oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.
- A programming language is a tool that allows one to write code that will instruct a computer to do something.
- JavaScript is a high level language, which means that we don't have to worry about a lot of stuffs like managing a computer's memory wile it runs. Which makes JavaScript easier to write and learn.
- JavaScript is object oriented which means the language is mostly based on objects for storing data.
- JavaScript is also a multi paradigm language meaning that it is os flexible and versartile that we can use all kinds of different programming styles. And this styles are just ways of structuring our code.

## What do we use JavaScript for?
Javascript is used to add dynamics and effects to a webpage. Manipulate content (HTML & CSS), load data from remote servers and to build entire applications in the browser, which we call web apps.

Also, JavaScript can also run outside of web browsers. For e.g It is possible to use JavaScript on the web server using a very popular technology called NodeJS which doesn't need any browser at all and this allows us to create backend applications which are simply applications that run on a web server and to interact with databases, ETC.

There has been a huge update to the JavaScript language in 2015 which is oficially called ES2015 but porpularly called ES6, because it was the update that came after ES5. Also new releases has been introduced after the ES6 update which encapsulates everything we call Modern JavaScript.

You can also use JavaScript to build native mobile applications as well as native desktop applications thanks to tools like React native, Ionic Framework and Electron.

Now you understand how powerful JavaScript is and what it is used for, let's move on to other stuff.
