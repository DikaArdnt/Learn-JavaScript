## Instructions

- There is one assignment for each lecture in the JavaScript Fundamentals
  Sections Part 1 and 2 (not all lectures, but most);
- The goal of these assignments is that you can immediately apply the concepts
  you learn in each video;
- So after you complete each lecture, find the assignment for the video you just
  watched, and write the code according to the instructions;
- Take all the time that you need, no need to hurry!
- The solution for each assignment is at the end of Part 1 and Part 2. I advise you
  to check it out after you completed each assignment, or in case you have
  trouble moving forward in the code;
- In order to actually write the code, create a new script called assignments.js
  in the current project folder and link it to the HTML file we have been using, just
  like we previously linked script.js (an HTML file can include multiple
  JavaScript scripts). The console will now show outputs from both script.js
  and assignments.js ðŸ˜‰
- And now, go have fun with these assignments! By the way, all these
  assignments are about countries :portugal: :de: :india:
