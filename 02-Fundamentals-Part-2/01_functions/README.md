Fundamental building blocks of real world JavScript applications are function. They are one of the most important concepts in the language.

## What is a Function

A function is simply a piece of code that we can re-use over and over again in our code. It is similar to the variable but for whole chunks of code.

Remember, a variable holds a value, but a function can hold one or more complete lines of code.

```js
function()
```
