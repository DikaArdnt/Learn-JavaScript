## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a High level, object oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.

- A programming language is a tool that allows one to write code that will instruct a computer to do something.
- JavaScript is a high level language, which means that we don't have to worry about a lot of stuff like managing a computer's memory while it runs. Which makes JavaScript easier to write and learn.
- JavaScript is object oriented which means the language is mostly based on objects for storing data.
- JavaScript is also a multi paradigm language meaning that it is so flexible and versartile that we can use all kinds of different programming styles. And this styles are just ways of structuring our code.
