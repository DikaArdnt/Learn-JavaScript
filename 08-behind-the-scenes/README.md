## What is JavaScript (Revisited)

JavaScript is a high level, proptotype based object oriented, multiparadigm, interpreted or just in time compiled, dynamic, single-threaded, garbage-collected programming language with first class functions and a non blocking event loop concurrency model.

### High Level

JavaScript is a high level language because you don't have to manage the resources manually. It has built-in abstractions that takes all the work away for us. For example managing the memory. Aside from JavaScript, Python is also a high level language.

Languages like C or C++ are low level so reosource management are done manually.

The difference between a high level and a low level language is that high level languages are easier to write and use but slower or less optimized than the low level ones.

## Garbage Collection

Garbage collection is an algorithm inside the JavaScrit engine that removes unused objects from the computer memory in other not to clog it up with unecessary stuff.

## Intepreted or Just in Time Compiled

Computer processors only understand 0s and 1s which is not humanly readable, so JavaScript has built in compilers that transform JS code into machine code that the computer can understand.

## Mutli Paradigm

An approach and mindset of structuting code which will direct your coding style and technique. There are three main paradigms, namely:

1. Procedural programming
2. Object oriented programming (OOP)
3. Functional programming(FP)

Other languages follow a single programming paradigm unlike JavaScript that uses all three of them.
