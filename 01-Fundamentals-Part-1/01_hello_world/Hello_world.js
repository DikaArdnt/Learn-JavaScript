// You can write a basic "Hello World" program in JavaScript with the browser console

// To do that, type the command below in your browser console

alert("Hello World!");

// This will popup an alert that says "Hello World"

// More examples

let js = "amazing";
if (js === "amazing") alert("JavaScript is Fun!");

// This will pop up an alert that says 'JavaScript is Fun'
// In the code above, we took a variable (js) with a string of text 'amazing' and said:

// if the variable (js) is 'amazing', which it true, alert the text 'JavaScript is Fun!'

// If we change the string on the variable (js) and we try to run the program again, it won't work because the variable has being assigned to a different string. E.g

js = "boring";
if (js === "amazing") alert("JavaScript is Fun!");

// This script is false because js is no longer amazing but has been changed to boring.

// You can also do mathematical calculations in the console
